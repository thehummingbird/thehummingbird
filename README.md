### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a robotics engineer currently based in Germany working at [Schmiede.One](https://schmiede.one/) on agri-robots. I spend most of my time with ROS based Software Engineering and Perception.

I've previous worked in startups and MNCs as a hardware and software engineer.

I love teaching Robotics and learning more along the way (when I'm not building robots, I'm big time into making content around Robotics - as blogs and videos). [This](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPN4BAonS7QhKI-tODaA9cA) is my YouTube channel where I talk about ROS 2, Computer Vision and my journey in Robotics. [Here's](https://medium.com/@thehummingbird) also my medium profile where I write about Robotics, ROS 2 and my thoughts about a technical career.
